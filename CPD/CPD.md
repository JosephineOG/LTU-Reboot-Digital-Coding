Setting up

I learnt to folk a repository on github, then clone to my computer.

I followed along with the instructor in real time and then did it again myself.

I could not follow some of the lesson due to technical issues. I was able to go back and find a solution and continue in my own time.

I learnt what CSS does, how it works, rules, properties and values. I learnt about the box model in CSS and about box sizing and how to connect CSS to index.html using external methods.

I followed along with the instructor and practiced again myself in my own time.

I found this lesson challenging as my little boy was unwell during the lesson so I found it hard juggling my learning and family commitments. I realise I have to be willing to accept help from others with my son while studying. I also found practicing on free code camp and mimo app really helped me understand this lesson more.
